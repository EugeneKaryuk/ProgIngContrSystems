# Jupyter

https://jupyter.org/

Project Jupyter is a non-profit, open-source project, born out of the [IPython Project](https://ipython.org) in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and  scientific computing across all programming languages. Jupyter will  always be 100% open-source software, free for all to use and released  under the liberal terms of the [modified BSD license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
